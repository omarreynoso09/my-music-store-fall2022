## Create the user page

- Create a log in page.
- the route should be "/sign-in"
- Your log in page should ask for email and password
- When the users clicks the sign in button the application state should update;
- Use the "useState" hook in app.js to store the user hook.
- Send a callback that changes the state to your user log in page.
- When the user is logged in the sign-in page should only show a log out button.
- when the use signs in the header should show the user profile picture instead of the icon.


## Create cart page

The shopping cart is just a method to keep track of the items the user would like to order. We can use state to store this information and make all components aware of when it changes.

- use the "useState" hook to keep track of the shoppingCart in app.js
-- const [shoppingCart, setShoppingCart] = useState();



- Send a callback to your home page from App.js that can be used to add the items to the shopping cart.

- Create a cart page (The path should be "/cart")
- Send the shopping cart state to the cart page and display each item in the cart.

- The empty cart button should empty the cart
- the go back home button should redirect us back home.

When the add to cart button is clicked the item should be added to the shoppingCart(added to the shopping cart state).
